\section{Introduction}
In this paper we study the Lieb-Thirring family of inequalities: for
any $d$-dimensional potential $V$ and nonnegative exponent $\gamma$,
\begin{align}
  \label{LT}
  \tr((-\Delta + V)_{-}^{\gamma}) \leq L_{\gamma,d} \int V^{\gamma + \frac d 2}_{-},
\end{align}
where $V_{-} = \max(-V,0)$ is the negative part of $V$, and $((-\Delta
+ V)_{-}^{\gamma})$ is the $\gamma$-th power of the negative part of
the operator $(-\Delta + V)$, as defined by the functional calculus.

This inequality was originally used by Lieb and Thirring in the case
$\gamma = 1, d = 3$ as an auxiliary step to prove the stability of
fermionic matter\cite{lieb1975bound}. Its generalization has since
then attracted a great deal of attention. Of particular interest are
the values of $\gamma$ and $d$ for which this inequality holds, and
the value of the optimal constants $L_{\gamma,d}$.

It is easy to see that this bound cannot hold for $\gamma < 1/2$ when
$d = 1$ by scaling, and $\gamma = 0$ when $d = 2$ (because any
arbitrarily small potential in two dimension creates at least one
bound state). The inequality was proved for $\gamma > 1/2$ in one
dimension and $\gamma > 0$ in other dimensions in the original
paper\cite{lieb1975bound}. The case $\gamma = 0, d \geq 3$ uses
totally different methods and was proven independently by Cwikel, Lieb
and Rosenblum\cite{cwikel1977weak,liebclr,rozenblum1972}. The limit
case $\gamma = 1/2, d = 1$ remained unsolved for twenty years until it
was finally settled by Weidl\cite{weidl1996}, who completed the last
gap in the knowledge of the domain of validity of the Lieb-Thirring
bound.

Much less is known about the optimal values of the $L_{\gamma,d}$
constants. A natural point of comparison is the semiclassical
case. This regime is usually achieved by letting the Planck constant
$\hbar$ tend to zero. In this paper, we have scaled $\hbar$ away from
the equation for convenience, and the corresponding limit is a large
(or extended) $V$. Using the Weyl asymptotics one can prove
\begin{align*}
  \lim\limits_{\mu \to \infty}\frac{\tr((-\Delta + \mu
    V)_{-}^{\gamma})}{\int (\mu V)^{\gamma + \frac d 2}} =  L_{\gamma,d,\text{sc}},
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
  L_{\gamma,d,\text{sc}} = 2^{-d} \pi^{-d/2}
  \frac{\Gamma(\gamma+1)}{\Gamma(\gamma+\frac d 2 + 1)}.
\end{align*}
Therefore, we have $L_{\gamma,d} \geq L_{\gamma,d,\text{sc}}$, and we
set $R_{\gamma,d} = \frac{L_{\gamma,d}}{L_{\gamma,d,\text{sc}}} \geq
1$. This paper is a numerical exploration of $R_{\gamma,d}$, and aims
to provide insight as to its behavior by trying to solve the
variational problem
\begin{align}
  \tag{$P_{\gamma}$}
  \label{variational}
  R_{\gamma,d} = \frac 1 {L_{\gamma,d,\text{sc}}}\sup_{\int V^{\gamma + \frac d 2} = 1} \tr((-\Delta +
    V)_{-}^{\gamma}),
  \end{align}
  where we impose the condition $\int V^{\gamma + \frac d 2} = 1$ to
  eliminate the scaling invariance of the Lieb-Thirring inequality.

  A scaling argument by Aizenman and Lieb \cite{aizenman1978semi}
  shows that $R_{\gamma,d}$ is decreasing with respect to
  $\gamma$. Furthermore, Laptev and Weidl
  \cite{laptev2000gammathreehalves} showed that $R_{\gamma,d} = 1$ for
  $\gamma \geq 3/2$, and Helffer and Robert \cite{helffer1990riesz}
  proved that $R_{\gamma,d} > 1$ for $\gamma < 1$ by expanding
  $\tr(-\Delta + V)_{-}^{\gamma}$ for the harmonic potential $V(x) = 1
  - \abs{x}^{2}$ in the semiclassical limit.

From these results, we can deduce that there exists a critical
$\gamma_{c,d}$ with $1 \leq \gamma_{c,d} \leq \frac 3 2$ such
that $R_{\gamma,d} > 1$ when $\gamma < \gamma_{c,d}$, and $R_{\gamma,d} =
1$ when $\gamma \geq \gamma_{c,d}$. We now review available results
about $\gamma_{c,d}$ in every dimension.

\begin{enumerate}
\item For $d = 1$, Lieb and Thirring solved a restricted version of
  the variational problem \eqref{variational} where $V$ is only
  allowed to have one bound state\cite{lieb1976bound}. They
  proved that
  \begin{align*}
    R_{\gamma,1} \geq 2 \lp \frac{\gamma-1/2}{\gamma+1/2}\rp^{\gamma-1/2},
  \end{align*}
  which shows that $\gamma_{c,1} = \frac 3 2$. It is known that this
  restricted problem provides the optimal constant for $\gamma = \frac
  1 2$. It is however unknown but conjectured that this provides the
  optimal $R_{\gamma,1}$ for $\frac 1 2 < \gamma \leq \frac 3 2 $.
\item For $d = 2$, the same restricted variational problem was solved
  numerically by Barnes in \cite{lieb1976bound}, producing a family of
  solutions which show in particular that $\gamma_{c,2} \geq
  1.165$. It is unknown if this branch of solutions provide the
  optimal constant.
\item For $d = 3$, the restricted variational problem only proves that
  $\gamma_{c,3} \geq 0.862$, which does not improve the result of
  Helffer and Robert that $\gamma_{c,3} \geq 1$. It is conjectured
  in connection to the Thomas-Fermi theory that $\gamma_{c,3} = 1$,
  which would improve a bound in the stability of quantum mechanical
  matter, and is therefore of great importance.
\item To our knowledge, nothing is known or conjectured about
  $\gamma_{c}$ in higher dimension.
\end{enumerate}

In this paper, we describe an algorithm to find maximizers of the
variational problem \eqref{variational}. We formulate this algorithm
in the infinite dimensional case, and specialize it to the case where
$V$ is radial. Then we discretize it, and use it to obtain numerical
results.
\section{The optimization algorithm}
\subsection{Infinite-dimensional scheme}
Let us denote $E(V) = \tr((-\Delta + V)_{-}^{\gamma})$, so that
$L_{\gamma,d} = \sup_{\int V^{\gamma+\frac d 2} = 1} E(V)$. We seek an
algorithm to solve this optimization problem.

The algorithm is based on the following property:
\begin{proposition}
  For $\gamma \geq 1$,
  \begin{align*}
  E(V)^{1/\gamma} = \max_{\tau \geq 0, \norm{\tau}_{\gamma'} = 1} - \tr((-\Delta + V)\tau),
\end{align*}
where $\norm{\tau}_{\gamma'} = \lp\sum_{i}
|\lambda_{i}|^{\gamma'}\rp^{1/\gamma'}$ is the Schatten norm of $\tau$
with exponent $\gamma' = \frac {\gamma}{\gamma - 1}$, the HÃ¶lder
conjugate of $\gamma$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  \begin{align*}
    -\tr((-\Delta + V)\; \tau) &\leq \tr ((-\Delta + V)_{-} \;\tau)\\
   &\leq \norm{(-\Delta + V)_{-}}_{\gamma} \norm{\tau}_{\gamma'}\\
   &\leq \tr((-\Delta + V)_{-}^{\gamma})^{1/\gamma}\\
   &\leq E(V)^{1/\gamma},
 \end{align*}
 and equality is achieved when
 \begin{align}
   \label{tau_V}
   \tau = K_{\tau} (-\Delta + V)_{-}^{\gamma-1},
 \end{align}
 where $K_{\tau}$ is a normalization constant, chosen to ensure that
 $\norm{\tau}_{\gamma'} = 1$.
 
\end{proof}

Therefore, when $\gamma \geq 1$,
\begin{align*}
  (L_{\gamma,d})^{1/\gamma} = \max_{\int V^{\gamma+\frac d 2} = 1, \tau \geq
    0, \norm{\tau}_{\gamma'} = 1} -\tr ((-\Delta+V)\tau).
\end{align*}

What we gain from this formulation is that it is trivial to maximize
this quantity with respect to $V$ and $\tau$ separately. Indeed, for a
fixed $V$, the maximum with respect to $\tau$ is given by
\eqref{tau_V}, and for a fixed $\tau$, the maximum with respect to $V$
is given by
\begin{align*}
  V(x) = -K_{V} \tau(x,x)^{\frac 1 {\gamma + \frac d 2 - 1}},
\end{align*}
where  $K_{V}$ is a normalization parameter chosen to ensure that $\int
V^{\gamma + \frac d 2} = 1$, and $\tau(x,y)$ is the integral kernel of
$\tau$.

This suggests the following alternate maximization scheme: from an
approximate maximum $V_{n}$, set $\tau_{n} = K_{\tau} (-\Delta +
V)_{-}^{\gamma-1}$, $V_{n+1}(x) = -K_{V} \tau_{n}(x,x)^{\frac 1
  {\gamma + \frac d 2 - 1}}$, and iterate. By construction, this
ensures that
\begin{align*}
  E(V_{n+1})^{1/\gamma} &= - \tr((-\Delta+V_{n+1}) \tau_{n+1})\\
  &\geq -\tr((-\Delta+V_{n}) \tau_{n+1})\\
  &\geq -\tr((-\Delta+V_{n}) \tau_n)\\
  &= E(V_{n})^{1/\gamma}
\end{align*}

Therefore, the sequence $E(V_{n})$ is increasing, and since it is
bounded from above, converges. In general though, we are unable to
prove the convergence of $V_{n}$.

Note that, even though the scheme was derived for $\gamma \geq 1$, it
remains a valid algorithm when $\gamma < 1$. In this regime, though,
the monotonicity property is not guaranteed, and indeed was found to
be false in numerical computations.

This algorithm can also be seen as a fixed-point algorithm to find the
critical points of the maximization problem. Indeed, these are
precisely the solutions of
\begin{align*}
  V(x) = -K_{V} (-\Delta+V)_{-}(x,x)^{\frac 1 {\gamma + \frac d 2 - 1}},
\end{align*}
This is a self-consistent set of equations similar to systems such as
the Hartree-Fock equations of quantum chemistry. Our algorithm is
similar in spirit to the Roothaan method\cite{roothaan1951}. However,
in our case, at least for $\gamma \geq 1$, the scheme monotonically
increases the objective function, therefore forbidding the
oscillations seen in the Roothaan algorithm. Even for $\gamma < 1,$ we
did not see any such oscillations numerically, and always observed
linear convergence (\ie $\norm{V_{n} - V_{\infty}} \leq \nu^{n}$), or
slow separation of bumps, as will be discussed in Section
\ref{numres}.


\subsection{Radial algorithm}
The iteration described above can be written more explicitely:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the negative eigenvectors $\psi_{i}$ and eigenvalues
  $\lambda_{i}$ of $-\Delta + V_{n}$
\item Set $\rho_{n} = \sum_{i} (-\lambda_{i})^{\gamma-1} \psi_{i}^{2}$
\item Compute $K_{V} = \norm{\rho_{n}^{\frac 1 {\gamma + \frac d 2 - 1}}}_{\gamma+\frac d 2}$
\item Set $V_{n+1} = - K_{V} \rho_{n}^{\frac 1 {\gamma + \frac d 2 - 1}}$
\end{enumerate}

Most of our multidimensional computations were done in a radial
setting. To see why this is appropriate, consider the above iteration
for $d \geq 2$, when $V_{n}$ is radial. Then, the Laplacian splits
into $\Delta_{r} + \Delta_{\theta}$, where $\Delta_{r}$ and
$\Delta_{\theta}$ are respectively the radial and orthoradial parts of
the Laplacian. The eigenvectors of $\Delta_{\theta}$ are explicitely
known to be the functions whose orthoradial part are the spherical
harmonics, labelled by the integer $l$. Since $V_{n}$ is radial,
$-\Delta_{r} + V_{n}$ commutes with $\Delta_{\theta}$ and can
therefore be diagonalized in this basis (separation of variables). We
write these eigenvectors of the form $\psi_{i,l}(x) = \phi_{i,l}(\abs
x) J_{l,m}(x/\abs x)$, where $J_{l,m}$ is the spherical harmonics of
degree $l$ and order $m$. The radial parts $\phi_{i,l}$ satisfy the
equation
\begin{align}
  \label{eigen_l}
  - \frac 1 {r^{d-1}} (r^{d-1} \phi_{i,l}')' + \frac{l(l+d-2)}{r^{2}}\phi_{i,l} +
  V \phi_{i,l} = \lambda_{i,l} \phi_{i,l}
\end{align}
and each $\phi_{i,l}$ has multiplicity\cite{seto1974}
\begin{align*}
  h(d,l) = \frac{(2l+d-2)\Gamma(d+l-2)}{\Gamma(d-1)\Gamma(l+1)}
\end{align*}

Therefore, we can obtain all the negative eigenvectors and eigenvalues
by solving only \eqref{eigen_l}. Furthermore, since the lowest
eigenvalue decreases as $l$ increases, we can iterate over $l$ and
stop whenever the lowest eigenvalue becomes positive. Next, we compute
\begin{align*}
  \rho_{n}(x) &= \sum_{l} \sum_{i} \sum_{m} (-\lambda_{i,l})^{\gamma-1}
  \phi_{i,l}^{2}(r) J_{l,m}^{2}(x/r)^{2}\\
  &= \sum_{l} \sum_{i} h(d,l) (-\lambda_{i,l})^{\gamma-1} \phi_{i,l}^{2}(r)
\end{align*}
where the sum only ranges over all negative eigenvalues. This is again
radial, and therefore so is $V_{n+1}$. The radial algorithm is therefore:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the negative eigenvectors $\phi_{i,l}$ and eigenvalues
  $\lambda_{i,l}$ of \eqref{eigen_l} by looping over $l$ until the
  lowest eigenvalue becomes positive
\item Set $\rho_{n} = \sum_{l} \sum_{i} h(d,l)
  (-\lambda_{i,l})^{\gamma-1} \phi_{i,l}^{2}$
\item Compute $K_{V} = \norm{\rho_{n}^{\frac 1 {\gamma + \frac d 2 - 1}}}_{\gamma+\frac d 2}$
\item Set $V_{n+1} = - K_{V} \rho_{n}^{\frac 1 {\gamma + \frac d 2 - 1}}$
\end{enumerate}

Note that this algorithm is not an approximation, but an exact
simplification of the general algorithm for the case where $V_{0}$ is
radial.
\section{Discretization}
\subsection{Galerkin basis and weak formulation}
To discretize this algorithm, we use a Galerkin basis on which we
expand $V$ and the eigenvectors. This discretization is variational at
two levels. First, the choice of eigenvectors is restricted to a
finite-dimensional subspace. By the minmax principle, this leads to
overestimation of the eigenvalues and therefore underestimation of
$E(V)$ for a given $V$. Second, the choice of potentials $V$ is also
restricted, decreasing $\max_{\int V^{\gamma+\frac d 2} = 1}
E(V)$.

This property has the advantage that numerical examples can provide
lower bounds on the best constants for the Lieb-Thirring inequality,
with machine precision as the only source of errors. A disadvantage is
that the algorithm we use involves taking powers of functions, and
there is no natural way to do that in a Galerkin basis, and therefore
a loss of accuracy can occur at this step.

To use our Galerkin basis, we introduce a weak form of
\eqref{eigen_l}. There are several possibilities here. The simplest is
to use a change of variable $\varphi(r) = r^{\frac{d-1}2} \phi(r)$
to transform the equation back to the more standard form
\begin{align*}
  - \varphi'' + \frac {(l-\frac{d-1}{2})(l+\frac{d-3}{2})}{r^{2}}
\varphi + V(r)\varphi = \lambda \varphi.
\end{align*}

We obtain a weak form by multiplying by a test function $u$ and
integrating: for all $u$, 
\begin{align}
  \label{eigen_l_weak_bad}
  \int\left[ \phi' u' + \lp\frac {(l-\frac{d-1}{2})(l+\frac{d-3}{2})}{r^{2}}
    + V\rp \phi u\right] = \lambda \int \phi u
\end{align}

Expanding on a Galerkin basis $(\chi_{i})_{i=1\dots N}$, this problem transforms to
the matrix equation
\begin{align*}
  A x = \lambda M x,
\end{align*}
where $A_{ij} = \int \chi_{i}' \chi_{j}' +
\lp\frac{(l-\frac{d-1}{2})(l+\frac{d-3}{2})}{r^{2}} + V\rp\chi_{i} \chi_{j}$ is the
stiffness matrix, and $M_{ij} = \int \chi_{i} \chi_{j}$ is the mass
matrix.

When $V$ is expanded on this same basis, we can easily compute the
matrix elements, solve this eigenvalue problem, and transform back to
$\phi$. However, for $d = 2, l = 0$, $\varphi$ behaves like $\sqrt r$
at $0$, and this singularity of the derivative forbids an accurate
discretization.

Another possibility is to obtain a weak formulation of \eqref{eigen_l}
directly. We have to remember that since the $\phi$ functions are only
radial parts of a $d$-dimensional function, the $L^{2}$ inner product
between two functions $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$ is $\int \phi_{1}
\phi_{2} r^{d-1}$. This has to be taken into account in the weak
formulation in order to obtain a self-adjoint equation. Multiplying
\eqref{eigen_l} by $r^{d-1} u$, where $u$ is a test function, and
integrating by parts, we obtain : for all $u$,
\begin{align}
  \label{eigen_l_weak}
  \int\left[ r^{d-1} \phi' u' + \lp\frac{l(l+d-2)}{r^{2}} + V\rp r^{d-1}\phi u\right] = \lambda \int r^{d-1}\phi u
\end{align}

Then, as with \eqref{eigen_l_weak_bad}, we can transform this into a
matrix equation and solve it. The disadvantage is that the
integrations required for the assembly step are more involved, and
therefore we only use it for the case $d = 2, l = 0$ where the other
method fails.

\subsection{Finite elements}
We use a Finite Element basis of piecewise linear functions on a grid
of $[0,L]$. The grid was chosen nonuniform, with more points around
$0$, to accomodate the singularity of \eqref{eigen_l}. $L$ should be
chosen large enough that all the eigenvectors associated to negative
eigenvalues of $\Delta + V$ can be represented accurately. If $\psi$
is an eigenvector with negative eigenvalue $\lambda$, then, assuming
$V$ has fast enough decay, $\psi$ decays as $\exp(-\sqrt{-\lambda}
r)$. This shows that the discretization is problematic for eigenvalues
close to zero, as we shall see in Section \ref{numres}.

For our piecewise linear basis functions, it is easy to compute the
matrix elements when $V_{n}$ is expanded on this same basis. We then
solve the eigenproblem, and obtain the eigenvectors. To expand
$\rho^{\frac 1 {\gamma + \frac d 2 - 1}}$ on the basis, we simply
chose the expansion that is exact on the grid points. Then the
normalization can be performed exactly, and the iteration is carried
out.

    the error in $N$ becomes larger than the error in $L$. Right curve

  \label{fig:conv_NL}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Diagonalization}
The most computationally challenging step in our algorithm is the
problem of computing the negative eigenvalues and associated
eigenvectors of a generalised eigenvalue problem $A x = M x$, where
$A$ and $M$ are large sparse symmetric matrices. This can be done by
standard packages such as ARPACK\cite{lehoucq1998arpack}, which allows
one to compute the $N$ lowest eigenvalues. There are two problems with
this. First, finding the lowest eigenvalues of a matrix is numerically
difficult, and one has to use a technique such as the shift-and-invert
transformation to ``zoom in'' on the required eigenvalues. Second, one
also needs to accurately determine the lowest positive eigenvalue, to
ensure it is not negative. Since the spectrum is an approximation to
the spectrum of $-\Delta + V$, we expect a large number of eigenvalues
close to zero, corresponding to small-frequency Fourier
modes. Therefore, the group of eigenvalues one needs to locate (all
the negative eigenvalues plus the first positive one) is not
clustered, which leads to slow convergence of eigenvalue solvers.

\subsection{Implementation}
We implemented the algorithm in Python, using the Numpy/Scipy
libraries\cite{scipy}. We used the ARPACK eigenvalue
solver\cite{lehoucq1998arpack}. The code is available at
\todo{Publier le code ?}
\section{Numerical results}
\label{numres}
We used the algorithm described above to compute critical points of
the variational problem. Our strategy was to find a critical point by
running the algorithm on a suitable initial potential $V_{0}$ (for
instance, a Gaussian of specified width). Once convergence is achieved
for a specific $\gamma$, we can run the algorithm for $\gamma + \eps$,
using as initial potential the one found for $\gamma$.

\subsection{The case $d = 1$}
In one dimension we simply used a grid of size $[-L,L]$ with Dirichlet
boundary conditions. We reproduced the potential with one bound state
of \cite{lieb1976bound} by using for $V_{0}$ a Gaussian of small
width. In this case, the algorithm converges linearly (\ie $\norm{V_{n+1} -
V_{n}} \approx \nu^{n}$, for some convergence rate  $\nu < 1$), and very
quickly (about twenty iterations to achieve machine precision).

Countrary to what we will observe in higher dimensions, increasing the
size of the initial Gaussian did not make the algorithm converge to
other critical points. Instead, it leads to a slow divergence where
``bumps'' separate, each bump corresponding to the potential of
\cite{lieb1976bound}. Furthermore, we numerically checked that the
convergence of $E(V_{n})$ towards its limit is sublinear, \ie
\begin{align*}
  E(V_{n}) - E^{\infty} \approx K e^{- \alpha \log n}.
\end{align*}
Assuming for simplicity a potential $V_{n}$ consisting of two bumps
separated by a length $L_{n}$, then, because of the exponential
localization of the bumps, the error $E(V_{n}) - E^{\infty} \approx K'
e^{- \alpha' L_{n}}.$ Therefore, the sublinear convergence is
consistent with a logarithmic divergence of bumps. An analytic
explanation of this is an interesting open question.
\todo{Plot ? Convergence ? Bumps ?}

Based on these results, we conjecture that the potential with only one
bound state is, up to translation, the only maximizer of the
functional. This would imply that $R_{\gamma,1} = 2 \lp
\frac{\gamma-1/2}{\gamma+1/2}\rp^{\gamma-1/2}$.

\subsection{Heuristique foireuse}
\todo{Essayer de tirer quelque chose de Ã§a, ou abandonner}

Let us try to understand why $L_{n}$ diverges
logarithmically. Consider a potential $V_{n} = V_{1} + V_{2}$ composed
of two ``self-consistent'' bumps with distance $L_{n}$, with only one
bound state each, $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$. When $L_{n}$ is infinite,
$V$ has two bound states $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$, with same negative
eigenvalue $\lambda$. When $L$ is finite but large, perturbation
theory tells us that we have to seek the new eigenvectors as linear
combinations of $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$, maybe. We set $\eps = \int
\phi_{1} \phi_{2}$. For $\gamma < 3/2$, $V$ decays faster than $\phi$,
and, to first order in $\eps$, the Hamiltonian matrix in the basis
$\phi_{1}, \phi_{2}$ is of the form
\begin{align*}
  \mat{\lambda + o(\eps)&\lambda b\\\lambda b&\lambda + o(\eps)},
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
  \lambda b &= \lela \phi_{1}, (-\Delta + V_{1} + V_{2})
  \phi_{2}\rira\\
  &= 2 \lambda - \lela \phi'_{1}, \phi'_{2}\rira
\end{align*}


The new eigenvectors are
$\psi_{\pm} = \phi_{1} \pm \phi_{2}$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_{\pm} =
\lambda (1\pm\eps)$ (confirmed numerically), propertly normalized:
$\psi_{\pm} = K(\phi_{1}\pm\phi_{2})(1\mp \frac 1 4 \eps)$, $K$ constant.

Then, up to normalization
\begin{align*}
  \rho_{n} &= (-\lambda_{+})^{\gamma-1} \psi_{+}^{2} +
  (-\lambda_{-})^{\gamma-1} \psi_{-}^{2}\\
  &= (-\lambda)^{\gamma-1}\left[(\psi_{+}^{2} + \psi_{-}^{2}) +
  -\eps \phi_{1} \phi_{2} + (\gamma-1)\eps (\psi_{+}^{2} -
  \psi_{-}^{2})\right] + o(\eps)\\
&= 2(-\lambda)^{\gamma-1}\left[\phi_1^{2} + \phi_2^{2} -
  \eps (3/2-\gamma) \phi_{1} \phi_{2}\right] + o(\eps)
\end{align*}
$V_{n+1}$ will have the shape of
\begin{align*}
  \phi_{1}^{2} + \phi_{2}^{2} - K \eps \phi_{1} \phi_{2}
  &= (\phi_{1} - \frac 1 2 K \eps \phi_{2})^{2} + (1 - \frac 1 4 K^{2}
  \eps^{2})\phi_{2}^{2},
\end{align*}
$K = 3/2 - \eps > 0$

Neglecting the second term (?), assuming wlog that the maximum of
$\phi_{1}$ is at zero, the maximum is achieved when
\begin{align*}
  \phi_{1}'(x) &= - \frac 1 2 K \eps \\
  \phi_{1}''(0) x &= - \frac 1 2 K  \eps \phi_{2}'(0)
\end{align*}
Therefore, 
\begin{align*}
  L_{n+1} \approx L_{n} + K' e^{-2\alpha L_{n}},
\end{align*}
where $K'$ is a positive quantity. The equation matches
\begin{align*}
  L_{n} = L_{1} +  \frac 1 {2\alpha} \log n
\end{align*}

This is confirmed by a numerical fit.

\subsection{The case $d = 2$}
Due to the high cost of accurately solving the maximization problem in
more than one dimension, we only obtained partial results in the
non-radial $2D$ case. The results we obtained indicate that the
algorithm either converges to radial critical points, or form slowly
separating bumps, as in one dimension. We have been unable to find any
examples of non-radial critical points, although this does not mean
that they don't exist.

In the radial case, we followed branches of critical points of
\eqref{variational} using the following method. First, we obtain a
critical point of $P_{\gamma_{0}},$ for some given $\gamma_{0}$. This
is done by the algorithm described previously, with as initial guess a
normalized gaussian of prescribed width, wich we vary between
runs. Then, once we obtain a critical point $V_{\gamma_{0}}$, we can
use it as an initial guess to find a critical point at $\gamma =
\gamma_{0} + \Delta \gamma$, where $\Delta \gamma$ is a small
increment. Iterating, we follow a branch of critical points of the
maximization problem \eqref{variational}. This procedure is
mathematically sound away from bifurcations. We have been unable to
complete an analysis of bifurcations, for instance using the implicit
function theorem. However, we have identified cases where the branch
following procedure described above gains a new bound state, which
causes discontinuities, at least in the discrete setting, as
illustrated \figref{fig:bifur}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \scalebox{0.4}{ \includegraphics{plots/bifur_R.pdf}\includegraphics{plots/bifur_V.pdf}}
  \caption{The branch with three bound states gains a new bound state
    with $l = 0$ as $\gamma$ increases. This introduces a
    discontinuity in the solution branch, and results in a longer
    decay. This effect depends on the precise moment where an
    eigenvalue crosses the zero threshold, and is therefore highly
    dependent on the domain size and discretization.}

Except at these bifurcation points, we found this branch continuation
procedure robust, as long as the step $\Delta \gamma$ is small
enough. By varying the shape of the initial data, and in particular
its width, we were able to obtain different branches of critical
points. Generally speaking, as the width of the initial guess
increases, the number of negative eigenvalues of $-\Delta + V$
increases. By increasing the width of the initial guess, we obtain
branches with an increasingly large number of eigenvalues.

We represent the energy of these branches as a function of $\gamma$
\figref{fig:2D}. We label them by the number of negative eigenvalues
they have. In case of a change in the number of negative eigenvalues,
such as in \figref{fig:bifur}, we label the branch by the highest
number of negative eigenvalues.

First, we see that as the number of eigenvalues increases,
$R(V_{\gamma})$ tends to $1$. This is in accordance with the
semiclassical limit. For a given $\gamma$, the Lieb-Thirring constant
will be given by the supremum of $R(V\gamma)$ over such curves. From
the branches depicted here, we see that the supremum is always given
by either the first curve with only one bound state for $\gamma <
\gamma_{c}^{1} \approx 1.16$, and by the semiclassical limit for
$\gamma > \gamma_{c}^{1}$. All the other curves are below these two
(although not depicted in this zoomed plot, this holds true for $0.5 <
\gamma 1.5$).

Based on our numerical results, we conjecture that $\gamma_{c} =
\gamma_{c}^{1} \approx 1.16$. The only way this could not be true is
if some other curve is above the one with one bound state. We have not
been able to find such a curve.

\subsection{The case $d = 3$}
We use the same method in dimension 3. Contrary to the dimension 2,
here some potentials with a higher number of bound states have a
higher $R$ than the one with only one bound state. The corresponding
curves in the $\gamma - R$ plane are flatter and flatter, and
intersect at a sequence of increasing $\gamma_{c}^{k}$. This sequence
accumulates at $1$ : this is a consequence of Helffer and Robert's
result\cite{helffer1990riesz}, wich predicts the existence of similar
potentials with a $R$ larger than $1$ for every $\gamma < 1$ in the
nearly semiclassical regime, with a highly oscillatory behavior of $R$
with respect to the width of the potential. Although our numerical
methods do not permit us to investigate this regime (it would require
a very large domain size, with a correspondingly large number of
points, and a very poor conditioning of the eigenvalue problem), we
expect the same behavior to occur.

Also in contrast to the case $d = 2$, the slope is not monotonic with
respect to the number of bound state, reflecting a greater variety in
the energy landscape.

\subsection{The case $d \geq 4$}
The case $d \geq 4$ is similar to the case $d = 3$, with a branch with
one bound state as the maximizer for small $\gamma$, until it is
outperformed by branches with a larger number of bound states, which
all fall under the semiclassical limit before $\gamma = 1$.
